          <p>Guests can be flagged by organizations for any behavior that is deemed unacceptable. Administrators have the ability to see all flags placed on guests within their network, as well as flag severity. When a host creates a flag, it is only viewable to that host. However, if you elevate the flag to an administrator flag, it will be shared by all of the hosts in your network. This allows all organizations to be alerted.</p>

      <h1>Story</h1>
      <p class="center">We are Josh and Brennan, and together we brought the idea of Risk Managed to life. Risk Managed was born in a time of adversity for us and our organization. An innocent summer night of fun turned into one of the worst nights our fraternity had ever seen, and the two of us were caught right in the middle. We were blindsided and distraught when our fraternity ended up under the scrutiny of the school and peers, especially under our watch as social chair and risk manager. And so Risk Managed was born, so that we can protect you, your organization, and your reputation from the same or similar adversity.</p>
